        "\n",
        "#### 1. Classification\n",
        "* `Data is labelled` meaning it is assigned a class\n",
        "* For example `spam/non-spam` or `fraud/non-fraud`. The decision being modelled is to assign labels to new unlabelled pieces of data. This can be thought of as a discrimination problem, modelling the differences or similarities between groups\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Regression\n",
        "* `Data is labelled` with a real value (think floating point) rather then a label.\n",
        "* Examples that are easy to understand are time series data like the price of a stock over time, The decision being modelled is what value to predict for new unpredicted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Clustering\n",
        "* `Data is not labelled`, but can be divided into groups based on similarity and other measures of natural structure in the data. \n",
        "* An example from the above list would be `organising pictures by faces` without names, where the human user has to assign names to groups, like iPhoto on the Mac.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Rule Etraction\n",
        "* Data is used as the basis for the extraction of propositional rules (antecedent/consequent aka if-then). Such rules may, but are typically not directed, meaning that the methods discover statistically supportable relationships between attributes in the data, not necessarily involving something that is being predicted. \n",
        "* An example is the discovery o`f the relationship between the purchase of beer and diapers` (this is data mining folk-law, true or not, itâ€™s illustrative of the desire and opportunity).\n",
